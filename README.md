## Win/Linux
* [Download](https://github.com/fontforge/YosemiForge/archive/master.zip)/[fork](https://github.com/fontforge/YosemiForge#fork-destination-box) and put the YosemiForge folder whereever you like.
* Copy the content of e.g. PixmapsDark
* Empty the original pixmaps folder
* Paste the content of PixmapsDark
* Open FontForge and select: `File` → `Preferences` → `Generic` → `ResourceFile` → original pixmaps folder/WinForgeDark.theme
* Quit and reopen FontForge

## Improvements
The scripts that automates the install process on Mac are more or less simple shell scripts so I guess they could be made to work on Win/Linux too<br>
